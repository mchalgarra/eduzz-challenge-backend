Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## Crud Repository
CrudRepository is a Spring data interface and to use it we need to create our interface by extending CrudRepository for a specific type. Spring provides CrudRepository implementation class automatically at runtime. It contains methods such as save, findById, delete, count, etc.

## Official Documentation
Spring Boot documentation can be found on it's [official website](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/).
